Android-FoldingLayout
=====================

A layout to switch over its children using a page folding animation

The current project contains a sample Activity and the FoldingLayout itself

Usage
=====

Just add the FoldingLayout to your layout and insert as many children view as you want.

Initially, the control will only show the first one. Execute the flip() method to turn the page (calendar-style) to the next one.

You can reverse the direction with the reverserDirection() method.

You can also setup an Interpolator in order to change the curve of the animation. A linear interpolator is used by default.
